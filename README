      swigger's notes on this fork

This project provides basic gdb support on 64bits jailbroken iOS (arm64 or aarch64).

How to make:
	./configure --host=aarch64-apple-darwin
	make

Tested on my jail borken iPhone 5s which runs iOS 8.4 .

Warning: it is partially working.

A sample toolchain is uploaded into sample_toolchain folder.
Unpack it and have fun.
Note: you should modify *.wrapcc.cfg and bash scripts like
 `aarch64-apple-darwin-ar` , make paths in them valid to make 
this sample toolchain work.
